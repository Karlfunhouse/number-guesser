Hi there!

Welcome to the README for our Number Guesser app.  We built this app because we were told to and there have been some valuable lessons that we have learned along the way.  

This app will allow 2 users to go head to head against each other with the goal of being the first to guess the number that has been randomly generated between the chosen min and max range.  Users are able to set the range to whatever they want.  The min range number must be lower than the max range number otherwise the range can not be submitted.

Once the range is set, each user will enter their name along with their first guess.  Guesses must be in the set range otherwise the Submit Guess button will be disabled.  Once each player enters their name and guess, they can submit their guesses.  

The player's names and guesses will populate in a section beneath the submit guess box.  This box will also let the players know if their guesses were too low or too high.  When one player guesses the correct number they will receive the victory message of "BOOM BABY!"  

After a user wins, a card will populate on the right side of the screen declaring the challeneger's names, the winner's name, how many guesses it took and how long the round lasted.  These cards can be deleted by clicking on the x button in the bottom right of each card.  

This is the comp we were given to recreate.  We pretty much nailed it.

This project was the joint effort of Karl Nielsen and Kyle Barnett as their first partner project in the 1911 FE program at Turing School of Software & Design.
